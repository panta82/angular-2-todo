# Angular 2 TODO

My first angular 2 app, made for learning purposes. It probably has all sorts of anti-patterns,
so you should look into the "official" implementations if you want to learn angular 2.

Based on [this yeoman generator](https://github.com/ruffiem/generator-angular2-application-scaffolder),
with some modifications in terms of build system. I added lodash and removed bootstrap (which didn't seem to work).
I didn't bother with tests for now.
